<h2>Introduction</h2>
The page title and description appears in google result so you want to set them carfully.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
The app title and description is set in the head of index.html. But how to set title \ description of the pages that we navigated to via the browser router ?

<h2>Solution</h2>
react-helmet

<h2>Points of interest</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to see the html and matching title\description in the html head per page using <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly">This</a>. <span style="color:red">However, this can be done only when the web application is on production</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Open questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>given that all pages are given title and description via react-helmet , should we use it also in index.html ??</li>
